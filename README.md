# IPython Training Wheels

An IPython Notebook profile with a few bells and whistles taken out (and others added) .

You can read more about [IPython configuration](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/intro.html) for how to create a new profile.


To test running this profile, you can either clone the repo into your `~/.ipython` directory like so:

    cd ~/.ipython
    git clone https://github.com/ivanov/ipython-trainingwheels.git profile_swc


Thereafter, just run `ipython --profile=swc`

Alternatively, you can clone this repository wherever you want, and then just specify the path to it like so:

    git clone https://github.com/ivanov/ipython-trainingwheels.git /path/to/some/dir
    ipython notebook --profile-dir=/path/to/some/dir
